# Car Classification -CompCars-

## Overview
This project focuses on **image classification on the CompCars dataset**. The goal is to classify cars based on their make, model, and specific features using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **CompCars dataset**, which contains:
- **163 car makes**
- **1,716 car models**
- **136,726 images of full cars**
- **27,618 images of car parts**

This dataset provides structured data for multiple classification and verification tasks, including:
1. **Car Make Classification**  
2. **Car Model Classification**  
3. **Car Part Classification**  
4. **Car Make Verification**  
5. **Car Model Verification**  

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/index.html).

## Project Goals
- Implement deep learning models  for **fine-grained car classification**.
- Experiment with architectures like **ResNet, Inception**.
- Improve accuracy through **data augmentation**.
